        <p class="aboutmep">I moved all the way from Virginia to California to pursue my education. I am currently majoring in Computer Science at California State University, Northridge. I am involved on campus as a Computer Laboratory Technician. I am passionate about giving small businesses a platform of their own whether it's through creating a website showcasing what they have to offer or an invoicing application for them! I like developing my own projects based off of my own interests as well. Ultimately, I would like to use my degree and experience to pursue iOS or Web development.</p>
